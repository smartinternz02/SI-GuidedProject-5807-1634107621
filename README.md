Essays are crucial testing tools for assessing academic achievement, integration of ideas and ability to recall, but are expensive and time-consuming to grade manually.
Manual grading of essays takes up an amount of instructors' valuable time and hence is an expensive process. Automated grading, if proven to match or exceed the reliability
of human graders, will reduce costs.  Currently, automated grading is used instead of second graders in some high-stakes applications, and as the only grading scheme in low
stakes evaluation. This application can have a high utility in many places. For instance, currently, evaluation of essay writing sections in exams like GRE, GMAT, and TOEF
L is done manually. And, so automating such a system may prove to be highly useful.

An automated grading system is built with the magical powers of neural networks. Using automation reduces time and effort in evaluation. NLTK libraries for feature extraction
and LSTM are used for the learning process.
